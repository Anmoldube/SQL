// How to create the table
CREATE TABLE std(
  std VARCHAR(20),
  Major VARCHAR(20),
  Std_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY(Std_id)
  );

The error Error: near "DESCRIBE": syntax error occurs because the DESCRIBE command is not supported in SQLite, which is commonly the database where this error is encountered.

To achieve similar functionality (viewing the structure of a table) in SQLite, you can use one of the following methods:

Method 1: Use the .schema Command
If you're using the SQLite command line, you can use:

.schema Std
This will display the SQL used to create the table Std, showing its structure.

Method 2: Use PRAGMA table_info
You can execute the following SQL command:

PRAGMA table_info(Std);
This will display a list of columns in the Std table, along with details such as column name, type, and constraints.

Method 3: Query sqlite_master
You can also retrieve table information by querying the sqlite_master table:

SELECT sql 
FROM sqlite_master 
WHERE type='table' AND name='Std';
This retrieves the SQL statement used to create the Std table.

// To drop the tuple we use 
DROP TABLE Std;      

// FOR COLUNM  ===>  ALTER TABLE stD DROP COLUMN gpa; 

// Inserting Data into Student Table 
INSERT INTO _Name of the table_ VALUES('Anmol', 'CSE', 1);

// Show table data 
SELECT * FROM Std;

// deleting from row 
DELETE FROM std WHERE Std_id = 5;

// update and delete
UPDATE Std
SET major = 'bio'
WHERE major = 'CSE';

SELECT std
FROM std;

SELECT std, Major
FROM Std
ORDER BY std DESC;

 SELECT std, major
 FROM std
 WHERE major  = "CSE" OR major = 'bio';

// If we want by definded name 
SELECT first_name AS ForNaam, last_name AS surname
From employee;

Find out all the different gender
SELECT DISTINCT sex
From Employee;


SELECT COUNT(emp_id)
From Employee
WHERE sex = 'F' AND birth_day > '1970-01-01';

Select Avg(salary)
From employee;

Select SUM(salary)
From employee
Where sex = 'M';

Ques:-  the count of male and female individual
SELECT COUNT(SEX), sex
From employee
Group by sex;

Select sum(total_sales), emp_id
FROM works_with
group BY emp_id;
